# System sleep

Omarchy enables suspend and hibernation by default, but if you're having issues with either on your machine, you can toggle them off.

### Toggle suspend

You toggle suspend by running `omarchy toggle suspend` from the terminal. That just reveals/hides the option under _System_ (or `Super + Esc`), and then you can see if it works consistently on your system. If not, you can hide it again with the same command.

### Toggle hibernation

You set up hibernation by running `omarchy hibernation setup` from the terminal. Hibernation creates a /swap subvolume on your boot drive the size of your physical RAM allocation, so make sure you have plenty of room to spare. On a 32GB machine, you'll always need 32GB+ free for this volume. Hibernation also requires the default Limine bootloader.

When set up, you'll see the hibernate option under _System_ (or `Super + Esc`), and then you can see if it works consistently on your system. If not, you can remove it again by running `omarchy hibernation remove`.
