### Starship Configuration
To use the Ristretto theme with Starship prompt, set the environment variable:
```bash
export STARSHIP_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/omarchy/themes/ristretto/starship.toml"
```

Add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish`) for permanent setup.
