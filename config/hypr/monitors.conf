# Scale is now auto-detected by omarchy-scale-detect
# Environment variables are set in ~/.config/environment.d/50-hypr-scale.conf
# Note: You must relaunch Hyprland after changing any env like this (use Super+Esc, then Relaunch)

# Use single default monitor (see all monitors with: hyprctl monitors)
# Format: monitor = [port], resolution, position, scale
# Scale is auto-detected and updated by omarchy-scale-detect
monitor=,preferred,auto,auto

# For manual override, you can uncomment and modify these examples:
# Example for fractional scaling that works well with GDK_SCALE,1.75
# monitor=,preferred,auto,1.666667

# Example for Framework 13 w/ 6K XDR Apple display
# monitor = DP-5, 6016x3384@60.00, auto, 2
# monitor = eDP-1, 2880x1920@120.00, auto, 2
