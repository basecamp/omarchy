# Trackpad: Disable While Typing (DWT) setup script
# This enables automatic trackpad disabling while typing to prevent accidental
# cursor movement which is a particuarly annoying issue on MacBooks and other
# laptops with large trackpads running Linux.
#
# To use this feature:
# 1. Open Omarchy Menu (Super+Alt+Space) → Setup → Input → Disable on Typing
#    (or run directly: omarchy-disable-trackpad-while-typing-tui)
# 2. Follow the interactive setup to configure your devices
# 3. You have to restart hyprland before the changes take effect. The TUI
#    prompts you to offer this.
#
# The script ONLY runs if both keyboard and trackpad devices are configured
# env = OMARCHY_TRACKPAD_DWT_KEYBOARD,/dev/input/event1  # REQUIRED - your keyboard device
# env = OMARCHY_TRACKPAD_DWT_TRACKPAD,/dev/input/event2  # REQUIRED - your trackpad device
# env = OMARCHY_TRACKPAD_DWT_TIMEOUT,1.5                 # Optional - timeout in seconds (default: 1.5)
