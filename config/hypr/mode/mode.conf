# Visual Mode
# ---------------------
# Purpose:
# This configuration file defines a visual profile for Hyprland.
# It is intended to include visual tweaks that you may want to activate 
# instantly without modifying multiple configuration files individually.
# By toggling this profile using SUPER+B, you can:
#   - Apply a set of visual changes quickly
#   - Stack desired tweaks in one file
#   - Roll back to the default setup instantly
#
# Use Case:
# This profile is useful in emergency scenarios or temporary adjustments,
# for example when you need a minimal visual setup to focus on content, 
# reduce distractions, or save battery.
#
# Note:
# This is an example of a minimal visual setup. You can add or remove 
# settings in this file to create other visual profiles as needed.
