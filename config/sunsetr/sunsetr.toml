# Sunsetr - Blue light filter for Wayland
# https://github.com/disluckyguy/sunsetr
#
# Sunsetr is NOT started automatically. To enable:
#   1. Manual toggle: Press SUPER+CTRL+N or use Omarchy Menu > Trigger > Toggle > Nightlight
#   2. Auto-start: Add to ~/.config/hypr/autostart.conf:
#      exec-once = uwsm-app -- sunsetr
#
# After enabling, sunsetr will automatically adjust color temperature
# based on your location and time of day (geo mode) or your manual settings.

# Backend selection
# Options: "auto", "hyprland", "hyprsunset", "wayland"
backend = "auto"

# Transition mode - how color temperature changes throughout the day
# Options:
#   "geo"       - Automatic based on sunrise/sunset at your location (recommended)
#   "static"    - Fixed temperature, no automatic changes
#   "finish_by" - Transition completes by sunset/sunrise time
#   "start_at"  - Transition starts at sunset/sunrise time
#   "center"    - Transition centered on sunset/sunrise time
transition_mode = "static"

# Static mode settings (used when transition_mode = "static")
# Standard daylight is 6500K - this means no color shift when first started
static_temp = 6500
static_gamma = 100

# Day/Night temperatures (used in geo and time-based modes)
# Research-based defaults:
#   - 6500K: Standard monitor calibration, matches noon sunlight
#   - 3500K: Warm incandescent, reduces blue light for evening use
#            (consensus default from f.lux research, gammastep, redshift)
day_temp = 6500
night_temp = 3500

# Gamma adjustment (10-200%)
# 100% = no change, lower = dimmer
# Research suggests 80-90% at night can help, but 100% is simpler
day_gamma = 100
night_gamma = 100

# Smooth transitions
smoothing = true
startup_duration = 0.5    # Seconds to fade in on start (0.1-60, 0 = instant)
shutdown_duration = 0.5   # Seconds to fade out on stop (0.1-60, 0 = instant)
adaptive_interval = 1     # Base interval for smooth transitions (1-1000ms)

# Transition timing (for time-based modes)
update_interval = 60      # How often to update during transitions (10-300 seconds)
transition_duration = 45  # Length of dawn/dusk transition (5-120 minutes)

# Manual sunrise/sunset times (used if geo mode can't determine location)
sunrise = "06:00:00"
sunset = "19:00:00"

# Geolocation is auto-detected on first run when using geo mode.
# To set manually, run: sunsetr geo
