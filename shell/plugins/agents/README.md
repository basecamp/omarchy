# Agents

One bar icon and one panel for every AI coding subscription on the machine.
The panel is strictly a display: it watches the usage records that
`omarchy-agent-usage-update` writes to `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`
and draws whatever appears there. `Panel.qml` owns the bar button and the
popup; `Main.qml` discovers and watches the records (and handles the optional
cross-device aggregation); `Agent.qml` is the per-record file watcher.

## Panel

- **Hero** — the mark, the tool, and the plan it runs on ("Max 20x", "Pro").
  Auth and endpoint problems replace the plan line and repeat in a card.
- **Subscription switch** — one chip per enabled agent (`h`/`l` or click).
  It appears only when more than one agent is enabled.
- **Limits** — the percentage of each allowance used, a matching meter, and
  the time until the session or weekly window resets.
- **Balance** — prepaid agents report a credit ledger instead of limits:
  remaining credit, a fuel-gauge meter that drains toward empty, and
  funded-versus-spent detail.
- **Tokens by day** — one row per day for the last week: day, bar, tokens, with today
  bolded at the bottom. Hover today for its prompt and session count.
- **Tokens by model** — tokens per model with the bar behind each row scaled
  to the heaviest model,
  the same way the weekly chart scales to its busiest day. Hover for the
  input / output / cache split.

A subscription appears only when it is enabled in settings and has actually
recorded usage — on this machine or on a synced one. With one such agent
there is no switch row at all; with none, the module leaves the bar entirely
rather than sitting there with nothing to say. A CLI installed mid-session
shows up at the next refresh, so nothing polls the disk waiting for it.

That self-hiding is why the widget ships in the default bar layout: a machine
that has never run an AI coding agent draws nothing, and the icon arrives on
its own the first time a scan finds usage. Drop it with
`omarchy plugin disable omarchy.agents`.

## Data

Each agent is one JSON record in `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`,
written by `omarchy-agent-usage-update`. That command runs one
`omarchy-agent-usage-<agent>` collector per agent; the widget invokes it
on its refresh timer and whenever you ask for a refresh, and picks up any
record that lands in the directory regardless of who wrote it.

Adding an agent therefore never touches this plugin: ship a collector that
prints the record contract (see the `claude` and `codex` collectors in
`bin/`), and the panel gains a tab. An `assets/<id>.svg` mark is optional —
with an `assets/<id>-light.svg` twin if the mark needs a dark variant for
light surfaces — and the bar glyph stands in when there is none. A record may
instead name the tool it runs with `"mark"`, and the panel uses that mark's
assets — how a second account of a shipped agent keeps its tool's icon.

| Collector | Limits | Local stats |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint (5-hour session + 7-day weekly) | `~/.claude/projects` transcripts, opencode sessions on an Anthropic provider, plus `stats-cache.json` and `history.jsonl` as fallback |
| `codex` | The Codex app-server RPC | native Codex CLI session files (plus pi and opencode sessions) |
| `fireworks` | Estimated prepaid balance: configured funding minus rated account costs | Fireworks billing API, grouped by day and model for the last 30 days |

Claude limits need a signed-in CLI; without credentials the panel says so and
falls back to local stats only. A non-default Claude directory is honored via
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, Codex via `CODEX_HOME`. Fireworks reads
`FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` first, then
`~/.fireworks/auth.ini` (which `firectl set-api-key` creates), then the key
opencode stores in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` when Fireworks is
signed in there.

### Fireworks balance

The collector first asks the account's `:getBalance` endpoint for the real
prepaid ledger. That endpoint exists but is permission-gated, and as of
August 2026 no console-issued API key passes it — Fireworks appears to
reserve it for the dashboard session. The probe stays because it is cheap
and the live figure lights up automatically if Fireworks ever opens it to
keys. Until then the collector falls back to estimating the balance from
configuration in `~/.config/omarchy/agents/fireworks.json`:

```json
{
  "accountId": "",
  "fundedAmount": 20,
  "fundedAt": "2026-07-01"
}
```

Set `fundedAmount` to the credits purchased and optionally `fundedAt` to the
purchase date; with no date, the collector uses the account creation time. It
subtracts rated account costs and the panel labels the result as estimated.
For a later top-up, increase `fundedAmount` by the new credit while keeping
the original `fundedAt`, so both the funding and spend still cover the same
period. `accountId` only matters when one API key can access several
accounts. Without a configured `fundedAmount` the tab still shows token
usage, just no balance. With a live ledger, `fundedAmount` is optional and
only adds the meter and the spent-of-funded line under the real figure.

## Accounts

An account is one subscription: a work Claude and a personal one are two
accounts, each with its own config directory — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for
Claude, `CODEX_HOME` for Codex, the only mechanisms that keep two logins'
credentials *and* transcripts apart — and each with its own tab, limits, and
totals.

The shipped collectors cover the stock directories. Every further account is
a collector of its own in `~/.config/omarchy/agents/collectors.d/`: an
executable named for the account's id that points a shipped collector at the
account's directory.

```bash
# ~/.config/omarchy/agents/collectors.d/claude-work   (chmod +x)
#!/bin/bash
export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-work"
exec omarchy-agent-usage-claude --id claude-work --name "Work" "$@"
```

The file name, the `--id`, and the record's id are one string — the update
command names the record file after the collector, and per-agent `enabled`
matches on it. `"$@"` keeps `--force` and `--limits-only` flowing. The
account appears in the panel on the next refresh wearing the Claude mark:
the record carries which tool it runs, so it never falls back to the bar
glyph. A user collector with a shipped collector's name replaces the shipped
one. Codex accounts work the same way with `CODEX_HOME` and
`omarchy-agent-usage-codex`; Fireworks with its credential environment
variables and `omarchy-agent-usage-fireworks`.

pi, omp, and opencode keep one transcript tree apiece with nothing tying
them to an account, so exactly one account may count them. The update
command resolves whose they are across every enabled account — it reads each
collector's tool and preference through `--print-identity`, then runs each
one with an explicit `--shared-sessions on` or `off`. A wrapper claiming
them with `--shared-sessions on` wins, and the stock account is switched off
for that run without any paired override; with no claim the stock account
counts them; with neither enabled they stay uncounted rather than landing
under a subscription they may not belong to. Two claims keep the first, with
a warning. A collector run by hand outside the update command falls back to
its own `auto`: the stock directory counts the trees.

Synced snapshots carry each account's tool, and machines refuse to pool a
name that runs Claude here with one that runs Codex elsewhere — the
mismatched snapshot is ignored with a warning rather than summed.

Removing an account is removing its collector and the record it left:

```bash
rm ~/.config/omarchy/agents/collectors.d/claude-work
rm ~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/claude-work.json
```

## Interactions

- Bar icon: left = panel, right = refresh, middle = next subscription.
- Panel: `h`/`l` switch subscription, `j`/`k` scroll, `r` or Enter refresh,
  Tab moves to the neighboring bar panel, Esc closes.
- IPC: `omarchy-shell omarchy.agents <open|close|toggle|refresh|next>`.

## Settings

Settings live in the widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. The
top-level keys can be set with
`omarchy bar set omarchy.agents <key> <value>`:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `refreshIntervalSec` | `900` | How often the usage records regenerate |
| `syncMode` | `"Off"` | `"On"` writes this machine's snapshot and merges the others |
| `syncDir` | `""` | A folder synced by Syncthing, Dropbox, rsync, … |
| `syncFileName` | `<hostname>.json` | This machine's snapshot file |
| `syncDeviceId` | hostname | Stable device name inside the snapshot |

Numbers need `--json`, or they land in `shell.json` as strings:

```bash
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents refreshIntervalSec 300 --json
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents syncDir '~/Sync/agent-usage'
```

Per-agent enablement is nested, and `set` writes its key literally rather
than walking a dotted path — so pass the whole `providers` object as JSON (or
edit `shell.json` directly):

```bash
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents providers '{
  "claude": { "enabled": true },
  "codex": { "enabled": false },
  "fireworks": { "enabled": true }
}' --json
```

`enabled` defaults to `true` for every discovered agent; set it to `false` to
hide a subscription that is installed. Disabled agents are also skipped when
the records regenerate.

With `syncMode` on, every `*.json` snapshot in `syncDir` is merged, so today,
the last 7 days, and the all-time totals cover every machine you code on —
active days are unioned by date rather than summed. Rate limits stay
per-account and are never merged. A record may declare `"scope": "account"`
when its stats are account-global rather than machine-local (Fireworks'
billing API); those merge by taking the widest value instead of summing, so
the same account synced from two machines is not counted twice.

One caveat on "all-time": the Codex collector only reads native session files
touched in the last 30 days, and Fireworks requests the last 30 days from its
billing API, so their totals and day counts cover that window. Claude's cover
every transcript still on disk.
