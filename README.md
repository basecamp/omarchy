# Omarch-me
Omarch-me is a fork of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) by DHH: "a beautiful, modern & opinionated Linux distribution". This fork makes minor modifications to the install scripts that allow you to choose yourself which default apps to install with the OS.

Open-source apps are prioritised, with unfree options being clearly placed in their own group for selection.
