# Omarchy

**Omarchy** is a modern, opinionated Linux distribution created by **DHH** — built with care, clarity, and a little personality. It doesn’t try to be everything. It tries to be *right*.

## ✨ What Makes Omarchy Different?

Omarchy isn’t a loud distro. It’s not trying to win a feature war. It’s designed for people who want:

* A clean, distraction‑free environment 🧼
* Thoughtful defaults that actually feel thoughtful 🧠
* A system that respects your time and attention ⏳
* A developer‑friendly base without the clutter 💻

It’s the kind of distro that feels like it was made by a human, for humans.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Everything you need — installation, docs, philosophy — lives at:
**[omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org)**

If you’re someone who likes simple things that work well, you’ll be right at home.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions (big or small) are welcome. If something feels off, confusing, or you just have an idea you want to try — open an issue or PR. Friendly collaboration is part of the spirit here.

## 📄 License

Omarchy is open‑source and released under the **MIT License**.
