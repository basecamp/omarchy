# Omarchy

Turn a fresh Fedora installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omarchy (adapted from the original Arch version for Omakub). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omarchy is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.

**Note**: This version has been adapted for Fedora Linux. The original was designed for Arch Linux.
